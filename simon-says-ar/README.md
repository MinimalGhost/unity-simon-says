# Simon Says AR Demo

A simple simon says augmented reality game built with Unity and Vuforia.

## Intalling / Getting Started

Ensure you have the latest version of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) configured with [Vuforia](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html#installing). You'll also need to have [X-Code](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed, which I suggest getting through the Apple Developer Portal for ease of use and open selection of versions for compatibility workarounds. Then just clone this repository and open it with Unity.

### Deploying to a device

This build was originally created using an iPhone 6 running iOS 11.3.1 and X-Code 9.3.1. If you are unfamiliar with deployment follow [these steps](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-game-ios-device-testing). There is currently a compatibility issue with iOS 11.3.1 and X-Code 9.3.1 that cause the AR Camera to malfunction and display a black screen. If you encounter this issue you can resolve it by following the instructions found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3roMSonIG5c).

### Marker Image

With the app running, open `marker.png` included at the top level of this directory and point your phone's camera at it.
